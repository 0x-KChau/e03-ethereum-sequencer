# Canton-on-Ethereum Integration

The Canton-on-Ethereum integration runs a Canton domain where events are sequenced by an Ethereum-backed sequencer. 

The folder `ethereum-docker-compose` contains pre-packaged docker-compose files to run Canton with an Ethereum domain, 
as well as supporting scripts and the documentation. 
The folder `ibft-testnet` contains scripts to generate and start an IBFT-protocol based testnet of Besu nodes.  

Check [Ethereum Domain](https://www.canton.io/docs/stable/user-manual/usermanual/domains/ethereum.html) for instructions for this demo and 
broader Ethereum Sequencer usage. The scripts also always start with a short description of what they are doing.
